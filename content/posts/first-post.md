# H1 heading

simple: main function takes a string and returns an object
accurate: better at catching and handling edge cases than front-matter parsers that rely on regex for parsing
fast: faster than other front-matter parsers that use regex for parsing
flexible: By default, gray-matter is capable of parsing YAML, JSON and JavaScript front-matter. But other engines may be added.
extensible: Use custom delimiters, or add support for any language, like TOML, CoffeeScript, or CSON
battle-tested: used by assemble, metalsmith, phenomic, verb, generate, update and many others.
